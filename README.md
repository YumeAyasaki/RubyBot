# YumeBot

My friend said that discord bot was too easy, that there're lots of tutorials on the Internet. So, as the worst sth functioning like a coder, i'll try to make a Discord bot and hope it'll at least, functioned...

Or sth like that, idk...

Update: At least it's functional...

Note for later use: 

* Put your scripts in Data folder, name it's rwby.csv. Scripts from the RWBY wikia...

* Trying to train bot on laptop can be not that good. Consider throw all to Google colab. Or buy more GPU. Idk...

* Will update later, if i comeback to it...
